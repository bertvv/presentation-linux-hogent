# Linux curriculum at HOGENT

Slide deck for my talk "Linux curriculum at HOGENT" at LOADays 2019 <https://loadays.org/>.

## Talk synopsis

An overview of the Linux curriculum in the "professional bachelor applied information theory" at University College Ghent

In this talk, an overview is given of the Linux curriculum at University College Ghent (HOGENT). This is *not* intended as a commercial, but rather to share our experience, and to ask feedback from the audience. HOGENT is planning to implement a curriculum reform the coming years and would welcome input from professional Linux users and admins. If you are a Linux trainer or teacher, you are welcome to use our course materials that we made available under open content licenses.

Talk topics include:

- course overview
- assignments
- student projects and team work
- open source/open content teaching tools and materials
